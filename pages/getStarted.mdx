# Getting Started

Welcome to Huddle01 SDK Docs! Here's a step-by-step guide to using our SDK to build amazing communication experiences.

### Step 1: Getting an API Key

To use our SDK, you'll need an API Key. You can get your API Key by following these simple steps:

<div className="border-t border-[#282829] mt-4" />

### Step 2: Figure out your use-case

Once you have your API Key, it's time to figure out how you want to use Huddle01's SDK. Here are a few common use-cases: (CTAs)

<Button
  variant="primary"
  url=""
  text="Clone a sample app"
  isRouting
  className="my-8 px-4"
/>
```bash npx create-huddle01 ```

If you're looking to quickly test out our SDK and get a feel for how it works, you can clone one of our sample applications using our CLI tool.
